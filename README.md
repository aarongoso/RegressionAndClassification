# RegressionAndClassification
A comprehensive machine learning project tackling two tasks: predicting housing prices using Linear Regression and classifying NBA All-Star status with Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). The project emphasizes robust data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables, ensuring high-quality model training. The regression task achieved a strong RÂ² score of 0.93, demonstrating accurate housing price predictions, while Logistic Regression excelled in classification, achieving 99.84% accuracy with near-perfect precision and recall. This project highlights the importance of proper model evaluation and offers insights into practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
